## Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tugark and I'm a software developer with a background in Geography and Geographic Information Systems. Currently, I think you could call me a classic **fullstack developer**, although I'm clearly happier doing business logic stuff than shoving pixels around or wondering why Safari does things differently than _literally_ all the other browsers. Oh, and I also like doing devops stuff, because somehow, seeing a pipeline go green makes me happy :rocket:

My main work throughout the last two years has been focussed on developing the new [GIS-Browser](https://geo.zh.ch/) for the Canton of Zurich, which is now also [opensource](https://github.com/gisktzh)! More recently, I started working on [Swissgeol Assets](https://github.com/swisstopo/swissgeol-assets-suite) and its internal refactoring process. Apart from that, I've been working on various internal projects for various customers, creating scalable, maintainable and beautiful software products customers and users love.

Last but not least - I'm highly interested in all things geospatial and all the new amazing things that are being developed revolving around geodata. Long gone are the days, where a Shapefile has been our main source of truth! ðŸ¥³

If you have any questions, feel free to get in touch with me :)
